## HOW DO I GET AN EMOJI ADDED TO ME?
To get your own Reactor emoji on all servers that have reactor follow these simple steps
1) Choose your emoji out of Discord emojis. Custom Emojis will NOT work!
2) Run command `-getemoji (emoji)`
3) Your emoji should be added to the next message you type

Example:
-getemoji :nerd:

Oops! I got my emoji wrong
If you make a mistake when setting your emoji go to #support on the Mesozoic Bots discord server and we'll try to help you out
